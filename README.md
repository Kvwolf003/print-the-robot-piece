## 📦 Overview

This project is a **hex bit holder** designed to neatly organize and store hexagonal tool bits or components. It features:

- 🔷 **6 hexagonal cutouts** for bit storage
- 📏 **Compact footprint** to fit workbenches or toolboxes
- 📐 **Vertical side rails** which can be used for guiding or attaching lids/covers

## 🧱 Print Settings (EufyMaker Recommended)

Use these settings in the **EufyMaker slicer** for optimal results:

| Setting               | Value                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Material**          | PLA or PETG                  |
| **Layer Height**      | 0.2 mm (Standard Quality)    |
| **Wall Thickness**    | 1.2 mm (3 perimeters)         |
| **Top/Bottom Layers** | 5                            |
| **Infill Density**    | 25%                          |
| **Infill Pattern**    | Grid or Gyroid               |
| **Supports**          | None (if printed flat)       |
| **Build Plate Adhesion** | Brim or Raft if needed  |
| **Cooling**           | Enabled, 100% after layer 3  |
| **Print Orientation** | Flat on base (hex holes up)  |

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Tool bit organizer for your workshop
- Embedded insert for toolboxes or drawers
- Modular holder to mount in vertical storage systems

---

## 🛠️ Assembly & Customization

- The **hex cutouts** can be resized in CAD to match specific bit sizes (e.g. 1/4", 6mm).
- **Rails** can be used for attachments like sliding covers or guides.
- For added strength, print with PETG or increase wall line count to 4.

## 🖨️ Tips

- Clean nozzle before printing for sharper hex cutouts.
- Monitor first few layers for proper bed adhesion.
- Adjust hex hole tolerance (+0.2 mm) if bits fit too tightly.
